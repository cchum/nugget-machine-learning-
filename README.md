Nuggets Game Prediction with Machine Learning: A data science project exploring NBA game outcomes using linear regression and logistic regression models.
The goal is to use historical Nuggets game data to find patterns that influence wins and losses and explore predictive modeling. The data set was used from basketballe-reference.com.
I cleaned up the data by taking renaming the columsn to make sure that anyone can understand what the columns mean. I made sure the data type were consistent, 
see if there were any null values in the columns. If there were null values in the columns, I investigated what could be the cause of the null values and fill in the missing values. 
I had dropped any columns that did not add any valuble insight to the data and dropped any columns that had redudant values.
